### ***Project Overview***
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
I will be investigating the TMDB Movies dataset to tackle the cinema industry and find insights and correlations between profit, popularity and IMDB rating along with the: Genres, Cast and directors.

### ***Questions for Analysis***
Q1: Whih actors participate in the highest profit movies ?
<br />Q2: Which directors participate in the highest profitable movies and with what genres ?
<br />Q3: Does the vote rating and audience popularity has a direct relation ? And how is this relation presented in profit ?

### ***About the dataset***
- This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
<br />- Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
<br />- The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.

### ***Steps to run this project***
__As this is a Jupyter notebook, most of the analysis is clear on the flow of the notebook cells itself. However, I have uploaded the cleaned dataset from the original data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata), along with the Interactive PYthon NoteBook.__
